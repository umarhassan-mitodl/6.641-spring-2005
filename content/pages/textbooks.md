[Electromagnetic Fields and Energy with Video Demonstrations](/courses/res-6-001-electromagnetic-fields-and-energy-spring-2008)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This text is aimed at those who have seen Maxwell's equations in integral and differential form and who have been exposed to some integral theorems and differential operators. The accompanying video demonstrations help the student connect what is analytically derived with what is observed.

[Electromechanical Dynamics](/courses/res-6-003-electromechanical-dynamics-spring-2009)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This text explains electromechanical dynamics, a subject that combines classical mechanics with the fundamentals of electricity and magnetism. Some of the examples include rotating machinery, plasma dynamics, electromechanics of biological systems, and magnetoelasticity. The examples used are mathematically lucid and physically demonstrable.

[Electromagnetic Field Theory](/courses/res-6-002-electromagnetic-field-theory-a-problem-solving-approach-spring-2008)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This text is an introduction at the junior level to electromagnetic field theory. The course starts with the Coulomb-Lorentz force law on a point charge. The theory is extended by the continuous superposition of solutions from previously developed simpler problems leading to the general integral and differential field laws. This book features many worked examples emphasizing physical processes, devices, and models.
