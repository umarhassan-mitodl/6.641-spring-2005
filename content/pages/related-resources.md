[Video Demonstrations in Lasers and Optics](/courses/res-6-006-video-demonstrations-in-lasers-and-optics-spring-2008) contains demonstrations used to illustrate the theory and applications of optics. These videos, developed by Prof. Shaoul Ezekiel, cover topics including light polarization, reflections at boundaries, Brewster's angle, critical angle, Fraunhofer diffraction from slits, optical fibers, and lasers.

These video segments were used in two ways: some were presented in lectures and recitations, and some were assigned for outside viewing. Homework problems based on phenomena in the videos were also prepared and assigned.
