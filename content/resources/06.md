description: Excerpt from the course textbook on electromagnetic fields and energy.
  Topics include polarization density, laws and continuity conditions with polarization,
  permanent polarization, constitutive laws, fields in the presence of electrically
  linear dielectrics, piece-wise uniform electrically linear dielectrics, and smoothly
  inhomogeneous electrically linear dielectrics.
