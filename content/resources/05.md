description: Excerpt from the course textbook on electromagnetic fields and energy.
  Topics include particular and homogeneous solutions to Poisson and Laplace equations,
  uniqueness of solutions, continuity conditions, solutions to Laplace equation in
  Cartesian coordinates, in polar coordinates and spherical coordinates with examples,
  model expansion to satisfy boundary conditions, solutions to Poisson's equation
  with boundary conditions, and three dimensional solutions to Laplace equations.
