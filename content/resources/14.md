description: Excerpt from the course textbook on electromagnetic fields and energy.
  Topics include distributed parameter equivalents and models, transverse electromagnetic
  waves, transient on infinite transmission lines, transient on bounded transmission
  lines, transmission lines in the sinusoidal steady state, reflection coefficient
  representation of transmission lines, distributed parameter equivalents and models
  with dissipation, uniform and TEM waves in ohmic conductors, and quasi-one-dimensional
  models.
