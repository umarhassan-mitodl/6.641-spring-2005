description: Excerpt from the course textbook on electromagnetic fields and energy.
  Topics include conduction constitutive laws, Steady Ohmic conduction, distributed
  current sources and associated fields, superposition and uniqueness of steady conduction
  solutions, steady current in piece-wise uniform conductors, conduction analogs,
  charge relaxation in uniform conductors, conduction analogs, charge relaxation in
  uniform conductors, electroquasistatic laws of inhomogeneous materials, and charge
  relaxation in uniform and piece-wise systems.
