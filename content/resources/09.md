description: Excerpt from the course textbook on electromagnetic fields and energy.
  Topics include magnetization density, laws and continuity condition with magnetization,
  permanent magnetization, magnetization constitutive laws, fields in the presence
  of magnetically linear insulating materials, fields in piece-wise uniform magnetically
  linear materials, and magnetic circuits.
