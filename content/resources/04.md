description: 'Excerpt from the course textbook on electromagnetic fields and energy.
  Topics include irrotational field represented by scalar potential: the gradient
  operator and gradient integral theorem, Poisson''s equation, superposition principle,
  fields associated with charge singularities, solution for Poisson''s equation for
  specified charge distribution, electroquasistatic fields in the presence of perfect
  conductors, methods of images, and charge simulation approach to boundary value
  problems.'
