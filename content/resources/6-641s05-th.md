  by a field core that carries a current and has a rectangular channel, with moving
  conductive fluid, that passes through its gap. (Image by Prof. Markus Zahn.)

  caption: Magnetohydrodynamic generator from the 2003 final exam ([PDF](/courses/6-641-electromagnetic-fields-forces-and-motion-spring-2005/resources/final1-1)).
    The C-core magnetic circuit is excited by a field coil that carries a current
    and has a rectangular channel with moving conductive fluid that passes through
    the magnetic circuit gap. (Image by Prof. Markus Zahn.)
