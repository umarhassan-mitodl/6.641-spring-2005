Topics covered include: electromagnetic forces, force densities, and stress tensors, including magnetization and polarization; thermodynamics of electromagnetic fields, equations of motion, and energy conservation; applications to synchronous, induction, and commutator machines; sensors and transducers; microelectromechanical systems; propagation and stability of electromechanical waves; and charge transport phenomena.\n\n##### Acknowledgement\n\nThe instructor would like to thank Thomas Larsen for transcribing into LaTeX selected homework problems, homework solutions, and exams.\n",
